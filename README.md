# Sugarcane Data Analysis Project ðŸŒ¾

## Overview  
This project focuses on the exploratory data analysis (EDA) of sugarcane datasets to uncover key insights and trends. The aim is to provide actionable intelligence that can aid in decision-making for the agricultural sector.

## Features  
- Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values, handled duplicates, and corrected data types for consistency.  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized data trends using advanced plotting techniques.  
- Statistical Analysis: Extracted meaningful patterns to understand the impact of various factors on sugarcane production.  
- Actionable Insights: Generated findings to improve strategies in the sugarcane industry.

## Tools & Technologies  
- Programming Language: Python  
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  

## Repository Structure  
```
